# PROJ1_KNearest_Neighbors_Classifier_In_Python

Diving into the KNearest Neighbors Classification Algorithm, I went ahead and used a popular IRIS Plants dataset for my project. My K Nearest Neighbor classifier can predict the type of IRIS plant based on the input features of respective plant dimensions.
